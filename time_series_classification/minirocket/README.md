# Univariate Time Series Classification with MiniRocket

This subdirectory contains a customized and extended version of the [MiniRocket](https://github.com/angus924/minirocket) model for **univariate time series classification**.

We provide:
- Augmentation-compatible pipeline
- Example shell script for easy reproducibility
- Clear setup instructions for your environment

> üìÅ Module path: `time_series_classification/miniRocket/`

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jafarbakhshaliyev/msc_thesis.git
cd msc_thesis/time_series_classification/miniRocket/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Please download and install the required Python packages manually depending on your setup.

### 3. Download Dataset

Download the UCR Time Series Classification Archive dataset from:

https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data_2018/

Extract and place the dataset in the following directory structure:

`./minirocket/UCR/`


## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Pipeline

We provide a shell script located at `scripts/example.sh` to run MiniRocket with augmentations on a sample dataset.

### ‚úÖ What to Edit

**Open:** `scripts/example.sh`

**Update:**

**Line 9** ‚Äì set your data directory path:

```bash
cd /your/path/to/data/directory/
```


### Run the Script

```bash
bash scripts/example.sh
```

## üìÅ Configure Dataset Path

**Open:** `main.py`

**Update:**

**Line 18** ‚Äì set your data path to the location where your UCR dataset files are stored:

```python
UCR_PATH  = "/your/full/path/to/data/"
```

Place UCR datasets in the correct subdirectories expected by the code.


## Example Usage

This implementation supports univariate datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive.

**Example datasets tested:**
- Coffee
- ItalyPowerDemand
- TwoLeadECG

Make sure files are correctly named and placed under the expected directories.
