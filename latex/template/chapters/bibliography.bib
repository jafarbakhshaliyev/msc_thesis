	abstract = {Exponential smoothing is one of the most popular forecasting methods. We present a technique for the bootstrap aggregation (bagging) of exponential smoothing methods, which results in significant improvements in the forecasts. The bagging uses a Box--Cox transformation followed by an STL decomposition to separate the time series into the trend, seasonal part, and remainder. The remainder is then bootstrapped using a moving block bootstrap, and a new series is assembled using this bootstrapped remainder. An ensemble of exponential smoothing models is then estimated on the bootstrapped series, and the resulting point forecasts are combined. We evaluate this new method on the M3 data set, and show that it outperforms the original exponential smoothing models consistently. On the monthly data, we achieve better results than any of the original M3 participants.},

	abstract = {Recent advancements in hardware technology have spurred a surge in the popularity and ubiquity of wearable sensors, opening up new applications within the medical domain. This proliferation has resulted in a notable increase in the availability of Time Series (TS) data characterizing behavioral or physiological information from the patient, leading to initiatives toward leveraging machine learning and data analysis techniques. Nonetheless, the complexity and time required for collecting data remain significant hurdles, limiting dataset sizes and hindering the effectiveness of machine learning. Data Augmentation (DA) stands out as a prime solution, facilitating the generation of synthetic data to address challenges associated with acquiring medical data. DA has shown to consistently improve performances when images are involved. As a result, investigations have been carried out to check DA for TS, in particular for TS classification. However, the current state of DA in TS classification faces challenges, including methodological taxonomies restricted to the univariate case, insufficient direction to select suitable DA methods and a lack of conclusive evidence regarding the amount of synthetic data required to attain optimal outcomes. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey and experiments on DA techniques for TS and their application to TS classification. We propose an updated taxonomy spanning across three families of Time Series Data Augmentation (TSDA): Random Transformation (RT), Pattern Mixing (PM), and Generative Models (GM). Additionally, we empirically evaluate 12 TSDA methods across diverse datasets used in medical-related applications, including OPPORTUNITY and HAR for Human Activity Recognition, DEAP for emotion recognition, BioVid Heat Pain Database (BVDB), and PainMonit Database (PMDB) for pain recognition. Through comprehensive experimental analysis, we identify the most optimal DA techniques and provide recommendations for researchers regarding the generation of synthetic data to maximize outcomes from DA methods. Our findings show that despite their simplicity, DA methods of the RT family are the most consistent in increasing performances compared to not using any augmentation.},

Though its application in electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has enhanced the understanding and the applicability of many disease diagnosis in clinic, lack of annotated data hampers the deep learning-based ECG analysis as large amount of data is required for a well-performed deep learning model. Data augmentation, which refers to the procedure that enriches the dataset by introducing unobserved samples, plays an important role in this respect. Despite the successful usage of data augmentation in the image-based deep learning analysis, its application in one-dimensional physiological signals, such as ECG, is still limited. In this chapter, we summarize the data augmentation methods applicable for ECG analysis and examine their performance on a task for detecting atrial fibrillation (AF).},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel data augmentation method for time-series classification is proposed. In the introduced method, a new time-series is obtained in warped space between suboptimally aligned input examples of different lengths. Specifically, the alignment is carried out constraining the warping path and reducing its flexibility. It is shown that the resultant synthetic time-series can form new class boundaries and enrich the training dataset. In this work, the comparative evaluation of the proposed augmentation method against related techniques on representative multivariate time-series datasets is presented. The performance of methods is examined using the nearest neighbor classifier with the dynamic time warping (NN-DTW), LogDet divergence-based metric learning with triplet constraints (LDMLT), and the recently introduced time-series cluster kernel (NN-TCK). The impact of the augmentation on the classification performance is investigated, taking into account entire datasets and cases with a small number of training examples. The extensive evaluation reveals that the introduced method outperforms related augmentation algorithms in terms of the obtained classification accuracy.},

Part of this success can be attributed to the reliance on big data to increase generalization. However, in the field of time series recognition, many datasets are often very small. One method of addressing this problem is through the use of data augmentation. In this paper, we survey data augmentation techniques for time series and their application to time series classification with neural networks. We propose a taxonomy and outline the four families in time series data augmentation, including transformation-based methods, pattern mixing, generative models, and decomposition methods. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate 12 time series data augmentation methods on 128 time series classification datasets with six different types of neural networks. Through the results, we are able to analyze the characteristics, advantages and disadvantages, and recommendations of each data augmentation method. This survey aims to help in the selection of time series data augmentation for neural network applications.},

	abstract = {Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is an algorithm to align temporal sequences with possible local non-linear distortions, and has been widely applied to audio, video and graphics data alignments. DTW is essentially a point-to-point matching method under some boundary and temporal consistency constraints. Although DTW obtains a global optimal solution, it does not necessarily achieve locally sensible matchings. Concretely, two temporal points with entirely dissimilar local structures may be matched by DTW. To address this problem, we propose an improved alignment algorithm, named shape Dynamic Time Warping (shapeDTW), which enhances DTW by taking point-wise local structural information into consideration. shapeDTW is inherently a DTW algorithm, but additionally attempts to pair locally similar structures and to avoid matching points with distinct neighborhood structures. We apply shapeDTW to align audio signal pairs having ground-truth alignments, as well as artificially simulated pairs of aligned sequences, and obtain quantitatively much lower alignment errors than DTW and its two variants. When shapeDTW is used as a distance measure in a nearest neighbor classifier (NN-shapeDTW) to classify time series, it beats DTW on 64 out of 84 UCR time series datasets, with significantly improved classification accuracies. By using a properly designed local structure descriptor, shapeDTW improves accuracies by more than 10% on 18 datasets. To the best of our knowledge, shapeDTW is the first distance measure under the nearest neighbor classifier scheme to significantly outperform DTW, which had been widely recognized as the best distance measure to date.

  abstract  = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable performance in time series classification tasks. However, the DNNs rely on a mass of data, which may not accumulate in real scenarios. As such, researchers investigate data augmentation methods to solve the scarcity of labeled data. Some of them, such as the rotation, that borrowed from the computer vision are not applicable due to the unique property of time series data. Besides, existing frequency-based methods applied for audio and speech recognition generate new samples by changing original frequency information, which may introduce unreasonable variation. In this paper, we propose a novel time series data augmentation method called Stratified Fourier Coefficients Combination (SFCC). SFCC retains and combines the original Fourier coefficients to augment the time series datasets. First, we transform data into the frequency domain using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). To maintain the initial data distribution, we stratify the coefficients into several groups and then randomly select the groups to concatenate the coefficients. Finally, a new sample is generated through inverse DFT. The experiments demonstrate that the augmentation by SFCC can effectively improve the performance of the DNNs and achieve state-of-the-art results compared with the other 12 benchmarking methods.}

	abstractnote = {This paper presents TS2Vec, a universal framework for learning representations of time series in an arbitrary semantic level. Unlike existing methods, TS2Vec performs contrastive learning in a hierarchical way over augmented context views, which enables a robust contextual representation for each timestamp. Furthermore, to obtain the representation of an arbitrary sub-sequence in the time series, we can apply a simple aggregation over the representations of corresponding timestamps. We conduct extensive experiments on time series classification tasks to evaluate the quality of time series representations. As a result, TS2Vec achieves significant improvement over existing SOTAs of unsupervised time series representation on 125 UCR datasets and 29 UEA datasets. The learned timestamp-level representations also achieve superior results in time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. A linear regression trained on top of the learned representations outperforms previous SOTAs of time series forecasting. Furthermore, we present a simple way to apply the learned representations for unsupervised anomaly detection, which establishes SOTA results in the literature.

@article{en16020764,
	abstract = {The diagnostic fracture injection test (DFIT) is widely used to obtain the fracture closure pressure, reservoir permeability, and reservoir pressure. Conventional methods for analyzing DFIT are based on the assumption that a vertical well is drilled in ultra-low permeability reservoirs with potential multiple closures but fails to consider horizontal wells. There is still significant debate about the rigorousness and validity of these techniques due to the complexity of the hydraulic fracture opening and closure process and assumptions of conventional fracture detection methods. The paper introduces a new method for detecting fracture closure pressure using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The new method aims to decompose the pressure fall-off signal into multiple levels with different frequencies using the CWT. This ``short wavy'' function is stretched or compressed and placed at many positions along the signal to be analyzed. The wavelet then convoluted the signal yielding a wavelet coefficient value. The signal energy is observed during the fracture closure process (pressure fall-off) and the fracture closure event is identified when the signal energy stabilizes to a minimum level. A predefined simple commercial fracture simulation case with known fracture closure, flow regime modeling, and actual field cases was used to validate the new methodology.},

  abstract  = {With the latest advances in deep learning-based generative models, it has not taken long to take advantage of their remarkable performance in the area of time series. Deep neural networks used to work with time series heavily depend on the size and consistency of the datasets used in training. These features are not usually abundant in the real world, where they are usually limited and often have constraints that must be guaranteed. Therefore, an effective way to increase the amount of data is by using data augmentation techniques, either by adding noise or permutations and by generating new synthetic data. This work systematically reviews the current state of the art in the area to provide an overview of all available algorithms and proposes a taxonomy of the most relevant research. The efficiency of the different variants will be evaluated as a central part of the process, as well as the different metrics to evaluate the performance and the main problems concerning each model will be analysed. The ultimate aim of this study is to provide a summary of the evolution and performance of areas that produce better results to guide future researchers in this field.}
