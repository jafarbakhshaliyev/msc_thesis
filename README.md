# Master Thesis: Leveraging Patch-Level Shuffling to Boost Generalization and Robustness in Time Series Analysis

This repository contains the implementation of novel data augmentation methods for time series analysis, specifically **Temporal Patch Shuffle (TPS)** and **Temporal Index Patch Shuffle (TIPS)**, with comprehensive experiments for both forecasting and classification tasks.

## Abstract

Data augmentation is a crucial technique for enhancing model generalization and robustness, particularly in deep learning models where training data is limited. While numerous augmentation methods exist for Time Series Classification, most are not directly applicable to Time Series Forecasting due to the need to maintain temporal coherence. 

This work proposes **Temporal Patch Shuffle (TPS)**, a general-purpose augmentation method applicable to both Time Series Forecasting and Classification. TPS extracts overlapping temporal patches from each time series and shuffles the less informative patchesâ€”identified via variance-based importance scoringâ€”to introduce meaningful variability while preserving signal integrity. 

For classification tasks, we introduce **Temporal Index Patch Shuffle (TIPS)**, a variant of TPS that exchanges patches across samples of the same class instead of shuffling patches within a sample. Both methods are lightweight, easy to integrate, and compatible with any model architecture.
